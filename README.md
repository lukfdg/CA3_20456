##Running the Project

###(opening the server with the code: python3 -m http.server 8080)

##Resume
###I personally took this assignment very serious considering that is something very useful to our daily needs as a entry level professional, so I tried to focus on tools that I can work more efficiently, so I decided to use only HTML, CSS and JS.

##Concept
###As a web developer I tried to apply many concepts in this project however to looks more professional I research more about some effects in different ways to create a functional and interesting page.

##Colour
###I choose the colour white for menu background and to contrast blue for text e a red (tomato) in details and effets.
###The same idea was applied to the main page however a light blue was chosen as a background color.
###This colours work very well together and the content can be read withou problems, remebering that, the tomato colour is the only high contrast in the page.

##Layout
###The layout is quite simple, but the way that I decide do present make all difference. Instead off a menu on top, I put on the left fixed so the user must click in each section to see each page, without or scrolling as less as possible.
###The benefits of this strategy can be multiple but to me as a "Salesman" I try to provide to user more interactions without tiring the user with too much content which can distract him.
###The responsive part work in the same way we have a menu button that can be reach on the top left, and the user can go to any page without scrolling.
###I divided in 6 parts (Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, Hobbies, Contact)

##Libraries / Frameworks and Coments
###Because of a short time considering the other subjects to study, I decided not use the recently tools learned from last classes, they probably could make my life easier, but I didn't have the time to get how they would work in my project so I decided use the basic in the most elaborate and effective way possible, always with a organization and coments

##Difficulties
###My main problems were the effects and animations for sure, my knowledge in this part wasn't that long, and after apply one, I discovered that effect affect my code giving a error which took me many nights trying to solve problems one by one.
###At the same time because my code was getting bigger and bigger I felt lost many times, duplicating div (I couldn't count how many), which make my life worse and I had to test any changes.
###To not be so confused I make more mistakes I had to create another css document, to separate and specific range of styles, probably that's not a good practice but helped me to be a bit less confused.

##Considerations
###I would like to say thank you for the classes and knowledge, this was a great opportunity to apply everything we learned in a real environment, long nights can teach us even better how everything can be difficult and rewarding at the same time.
###The project is not perfect, still there some probelms that I could solve, but I believe after all this massive assignments, I can still working on it and make it even better.git add *

##GDPR
###All the images used were made by my in the past or used in previous jobs that I've done.
###The icons were taken from Font Awesome.
